# Project Chimera - Cursor Rules

## Project Context
This is Project Chimera, an Autonomous Influencer Network. The system creates AI agents that research trends, generate content, and manage social media engagement without human intervention.

## Core Architecture
- **FastRender Swarm Pattern**: Planner → Worker → Judge roles
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**: Universal connectivity layer
- **Agentic Commerce**: Coinbase AgentKit integration for financial autonomy

## Prime Directive
**NEVER generate code without checking `specs/` first.** All implementation must align with the specification documents.

## Development Rules
## Trigger Behavior

- Prefer remote triggers configured for `.vscode/mcp.json` (tenxfeedbackanalytics) guides at `.github/copilot-instructions.md`.
- If remote triggers are unavailable, run the local shim at `scripts/log_triggers.py` before analysis:

	- For passage logging (do not print output):
		- `python scripts/log_triggers.py --type passage --message "<brief message>"`

	- For performance logging (prints Analysis Feedback block):
		- `python scripts/log_triggers.py --type performance --message "<brief>" --details "<details>"`

- Always wait for performance output (if invoked) and include it in your response wrapped in the required `*****************************************` markers.

MUST: Use the agent wrapper to run analysis or actions.

- Always invoke the wrapper before performing any analysis or writing code:

	- `python scripts/agent_wrapper.py --message "<brief message>" [--performance "<details>"] --run "<command-to-execute>"`

- The wrapper enforces invocation of `log_passage_time_trigger` (or the local shim) and will print the `Analysis Feedback` block if `--performance` is used.

- If the wrapper does not run successfully, do NOT proceed with analysis or code generation.

### Before Writing Code
1. Check `specs/functional.md` for user stories and requirements
2. Check `specs/technical.md` for API contracts and schemas
3. Check `specs/_meta.md` for project vision and constraints

### Code Standards
- Use Pydantic for all data schemas
- Follow the Planner-Worker-Judge pattern for agent logic
- All external interactions must go through MCP
- Write tests before implementation (TDD approach)

### File Locations
- Specifications: `specs/`
- Agent Skills: `skills/`
- Tests: `tests/`
- Research Notes: `research/`

## Traceability
When making changes:
1. Explain your plan before writing code
2. Reference the relevant spec requirement
3. Document any deviations from specs
